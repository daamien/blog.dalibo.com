[ldap2pg](http://ldap2pg.rtfd.io/en/latest/) is a tool for roles and privileges
synchronisation from a LDAP compatible directory. Configuration is simple yet
powerful, from a [YAML file](http://ldap2pg.rtfd.io/en/latest/config). ldap2pg
eases integration and securisation of PostgresSQL in your infrastructure.

After vacation, ldap2pg is available in [version
5.0](https://ldap2pg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog/#ldap2pg-50). The
project features a major functionnality: client-side LDAP join, aka LDAP
sub-queries. Joins are handful especially with Active Directory schema.

Since 4.0, ldap2pg shipped up to 18 releases, including:

- support for Postgres 9.3 and 9.4;
- simplification for LDAP queries configuration;
- finer configuration of role scope to confine ldap2pg playground;
- comment on roles;
- reduced execution time and memory consumption;
- safer loading of YAML configurion;
- better compatibility with Active Directory, by disabling `REFERRALS` by default;
- better compatibility with RDS by running withou super privileges and excluding
  RDS predefined roles;
- an official Docker image: `dalibo/ldap2pg`.

The new feature of 5.0 is the ability to configure client-side LDAP queries, a
major contribution from [Harold le CLÉMENT de
SAINT-MARCQ](https://github.com/hlecleme).

More fixes and updates are detailed, release after release in
[changelog](http://ldap2pg.rtfd.io/en/latest/changelog/#ldap2pg-50)


## Client-side LDAP Join

Client side LDAP join allows to reduce complexity in some schema, often
encoutered with Active Directory. When user authentify with it's
`sAMAccountName`, `ldap2pg` can't get user id from LDAP ref (aka *Distinguished
Name*). The query on LDAP group must be followed by a new sub-query on each ref.

Client side LDAP join impacts performances of synchronisation. If you have a lot
of roles to synchronize, prefer `memberOf` or review you LDAP schemas to reduce
queries.


## Docker Image

The Docker Image is an initial contribution from [Thomas
WOLF](https://github.com/Stanislasss). This image eases deployment on CoreOS or
Kubernetes. Image building is automated and images are tagged. Image is
available a few minutes after sources are released.

ldap2pg is also available as RPM package on
[yum.postgresql.org](https://yum.postgresql.org/repopackages.php). PDGD's RPM
team update package up to a few days after source release.
